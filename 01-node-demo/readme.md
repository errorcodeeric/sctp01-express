# Creating a new NodeJS application
1. Make sure you are the current folder (i.e the current working directory)
2. `npm init` to create a new NodeJS application or `npm init -y` to skip all the questions
3. Install Express with `npm install express`
4. Create a new `.gitignore` file and add the following: `node_modules`
5. For your Gitpod, run `npm install -g nodemon` everytime you restart Gitpod but
if is using your own computer, then just once. The `-g` means `global` -- it will be 
applied to all Node applications.
